## About
I developed the Hadila app to save  frequently faced problems that I can't remember exact solutions when coding android application.
It's happens to me generally.
But purpose of app is learning  libraries and improving my development skills.
I have spent a lot of time when searching below libraries and tools and learnt a lot things. 
Some of them I used  for the first time. I will continue to develop on this app because it kind of roadmap to me.
